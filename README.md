# Forecasting All-NBA Selection Probabilities

An ML forecasting project to predict future All-NBA selection probabilities for each player in the NBA. In this project I will use historic NBA player data to train a xGboost Model designed to predict the probability that a player will make an All NBA team. 


## R Script Guide:

*Boosting Model* - AllNBAProbModelScaled.R

*Player Stat Projection* - CareerTrajectory.R

*Example Application of Model* - LikelihoodAllNBA.R

*Interactive App of Results* - app.R


## Probability App
